# System_Design
- System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. 
- It involves identifying the different components that make up a system, determining how these components will interact with each other, and specifying the details of their implementation.

- System design is a crucial step in the development of any software or hardware system. 
- It helps ensure that the system is reliable, efficient, and scalable. 
- The design process typically involves a range of activities, including requirements analysis, architecture design, interface design, data design, and testing. 
- The output of the system design process is typically a detailed specification that describes how the system will be built and how it will function.

# System Design Basic Things to understand
1. How do server requests and responses work?

2.  Where can we store the code or algorithm we wrote?

3. How Computational power works in a machine?

4.  What are the business requirements?

5.  If Computational power or machine is not able to handle requests, then we have two solutions i.e

    - Make a Machine Bigger or else

    -  Increase the number of Machines.

6. Then Scalability comes into the picture i.e both Vertical & Horizontal Scalability.

7.  Learned the major difference between Both Vertical and Horizontal Scalability.

8. Get to know, today's real-world using hybrid formation Scaling both vertical and horizontal. It means Horizontal scaling using vertical machines.

# Scalability
- Scalability in system design refers to the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work or traffic in a seamless and efficient manner. 
- It is the capability of a system to grow and expand without having to compromise on performance or functionality.
- In other words, a scalable system can accommodate an increasing number of users, requests, data, or transactions without experiencing any significant degradation in performance, availability, or reliability.
- It is an important consideration in designing large-scale distributed systems that can handle high traffic volumes and serve a large user base.
- Scalability can be achieved through various means such as horizontal scaling, vertical scaling, load balancing, caching, sharding, partitioning, and other distributed computing techniques. 
- These approaches involve distributing the workload across multiple servers, nodes, or clusters to improve performance, reduce latency, and increase availability. 
- The goal of scalability is to design a system that can handle growth and expansion without compromising on its core functionality or user experience.
